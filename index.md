The [BikeLoudPDX](https://bikeloudpdx.org/) map pulls together various Open Data 
sources to provide useful information for route planning, community engagement, 
advocacy, and other biking and active transportation activities in Portland, OR.

Map data is provided by OpenStreetMap, PBOT, PortlandMaps, and various other sources. 
All data displayed on the map is pulled in dynamically, and will update automatically 
when changes are made to the original sources.

Map is created in plan ol' HTML, CSS, and javascript, so it's super easy to edit 
and maintain without messing around installing a bunch of out-of-date npm modules.
Uses [MapLibreGL](https://maplibre.org/) for map functionality, and a customized 
styling of [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/) tiles as the basemap.

Thanks to PBOT and [City of Portland GIS](https://www.portlandmaps.com/) for making 
so much open data available!
